Analysis: T1498 – Network Denial of Service (NDoS)
Exploitability Parameters

1.	Attack Vector (AV):
          o	Network (0.85) – The ICS CPUs are internet-facing and connected to AWS, increasing the attack vector's exposure.
2.	Attack Complexity (AC):
          o	Low (0.77) – Although ICS systems can be targeted with specialized attacks, the existence of multiple SIM-based networks and the AWS interface broadens potential attack vectors, making the complexity low.
3.	Privileges Required (PR):
          o	None (0.85) – An attacker does not need prior access to the ICS systems to launch a DDoS or similar attack.
4.	User Interaction (UI):
          o	None (0.85) – No interaction from users is required for an NDoS attack to succeed.

Impact Parameters
1.	Confidentiality (C):
o	None (0.0) – NDoS attacks do not directly affect data confidentiality.  

2.	Integrity (I):
o	None (0.0) – There is no tampering with data integrity directly associated with an NDoS attack.

3.	Availability (A):
o	High (0.56) – A successful attack could cause critical system outages, impacting both ICS operations and AWS-hosted instances. The impact is significant given ICS reliance on real-time operations.

Risk Score Calculation
1.	Impact Subscore:
1−[(1−0)×(1−0)×(1−0.56)]=0.561 - [(1 - 0) \times (1 - 0) \times (1 - 0.56)] = 0.561−[(1−0)×(1−0)×(1−0.56)]=0.56

2.	Exploitability Subscore:
0.85×0.77×0.85×0.85=0.470.85 \times 0.77 \times 0.85 \times 0.85 = 0.470.85×0.77×0.85×0.85=0.47

3.	Base Score:
0.56+0.47=7.030.56 + 0.47 = 7.030.56+0.47=7.03

4.	Temporal Score Adjustment:
Considering the defense tools (e.g., rate limiting, IDS/IPS, monitoring, and redundancy), the exploitability can be reduced by about 30%, leading to an adjusted score:
0.47×0.7=0.330.47 \times 0.7 = 0.330.47×0.7=0.33

New Base Score:
0.56+0.33=6.890.56 + 0.33 = 6.890.56+0.33=6.89

5.	Environmental Score Adjustment:
Factoring in the ICS-critical nature of the system and AWS redundancy, availability impact is heightened. Increase availability weight by 20%:
0.56×1.2=0.670.56 \times 1.2 = 0.670.56×1.2=0.67

Final Score:
0.67+0.33=7.00.67 + 0.33 = 7.00.67+0.33=7.0
